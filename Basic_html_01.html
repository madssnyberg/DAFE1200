<h1>Tags format the text</h1>
<p>Tags are used to format the text. Like the "Heading 1" and "Paragraph" that I have used here</p>
<h2>Basic tags</h2>
<p>Not all tags have a closing tag, for example <code>&lt;br&gt;</code><br />which inserts a linebreak.
    Then we usually end it with a forward slash in the end.
</p>

<p>There are several more tags, for example <em>emphasis/ italics</em>
    and <strong>strong/ bold/ fat</strong> text.
